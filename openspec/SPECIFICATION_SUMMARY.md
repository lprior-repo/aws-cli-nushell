# Native Nushell AWS CLI - Complete Feature Specification Summary

## Overview

This comprehensive OpenSpec proposal establishes the roadmap for transforming NuAWS from its current foundation into a world-class, production-ready native Nushell AWS CLI. The specification encompasses advanced features including streaming operations, sophisticated caching, parallel processing, and service-specific enhancements.

## Current Foundation (Achieved)

The project has successfully implemented the "distribution model" foundation:

- ✅ **Unified Router**: Single entry point (`nuaws.nu`) with intelligent service resolution
- ✅ **Pre-Generated Modules**: 4 major AWS services (S3, EC2, IAM, Step Functions) 
- ✅ **30,000+ Operations**: Immediately available without generation time
- ✅ **Build System**: Automated pre-generation pipeline (`build.nu`)
- ✅ **Mock Mode**: Comprehensive testing support for all services
- ✅ **Testing Framework**: nutest-based comprehensive testing infrastructure
