# dynamic-completions Specification

## Purpose
Implement intelligent, context-aware AWS resource completions with live data fetching, smart caching, and rich descriptions for optimal user experience in Nushell.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Completion Framework Infrastructure
The system SHALL provide a dynamic completion registration and management framework for AWS resources.

- **AND** the system supports both static and dynamic completion strategies

### Requirement: Context-Aware Resource Completions
The system SHALL provide intelligent completions that adapt based on command context and previous parameters.

#### Scenario: Command context awareness
- **WHEN** completion functions receive command context information
- **THEN** EC2 instance completions filter by state (running instances for stop/terminate commands)
- **AND** S3 object completions are filtered by bucket specified in previous parameters
- **AND** Lambda function completions include relevant versions when version parameter is expected
- **AND** completion relevance is determined by command semantics

#### Scenario: Parameter dependency resolution
- **WHEN** completing parameters that depend on previous parameter values

- **AND** RDS instance completions filter by DB engine when engine was specified
- **AND** ECS task completions filter by cluster when cluster parameter is provided
- **AND** dependency resolution handles both positional and named parameters

#### Scenario: State-based filtering
- **WHEN** commands imply specific resource states
- **THEN** start-instance completions show only stopped EC2 instances
- **AND** stop-instance completions show only running EC2 instances
- **AND** delete operations show only deletable resources (not protected)
- **AND** state filtering improves user experience and prevents errors

### Requirement: Smart Caching System
The system SHALL implement intelligent caching with TTL, invalidation, and performance optimization for AWS resource data.

#### Scenario: TTL-based cache management
- **WHEN** resource data is cached
- **THEN** S3 buckets have 15-minute TTL (relatively static)
- **AND** EC2 instances have 5-minute TTL (state changes frequently)
- **AND** Lambda functions have 10-minute TTL (moderate change frequency)
- **AND** IAM roles have 30-minute TTL (very static)
- **AND** cache expiration is checked before every completion request

#### Scenario: Profile and region scoped caching
- **WHEN** resource data is stored in cache
- **THEN** cache keys include AWS profile identifier for isolation
- **AND** cache keys include AWS region for regional resource separation
- **AND** switching profiles or regions uses appropriate cached data
- **AND** cache cleanup removes stale data for inactive profiles/regions

#### Scenario: Background cache warming
- **WHEN** resources are accessed frequently
- **THEN** background refresh occurs at 80% of TTL to prevent cache misses
- **AND** refresh happens asynchronously without blocking user interactions
- **AND** refresh frequency adapts based on access patterns
- **AND** failed refreshes don't invalidate existing cache until TTL expires

#### Scenario: Cache invalidation and error handling
- **WHEN** AWS API calls fail during cache refresh
- **THEN** existing cached data remains valid until TTL expires
- **AND** exponential backoff is applied for retrying failed requests
- **AND** manual cache invalidation is available for forcing refresh
- **AND** cache cleanup runs periodically to remove expired entries

### Requirement: Rich Completion Descriptions
The system SHALL provide detailed, formatted descriptions for AWS resources in completion results.

#### Scenario: Structured completion metadata
- **WHEN** completion functions return resource lists
- **THEN** S3 buckets include creation date, region, and encryption status
- **AND** EC2 instances show state, type, name tag, and launch time
- **AND** Lambda functions display runtime, memory size, last modified, and description
- **AND** RDS instances include engine, status, and endpoint information

#### Scenario: Consistent description formatting
- **WHEN** descriptions are generated for different resource types
- **THEN** date/time information uses consistent format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)
- **AND** size information uses appropriate units (MB, GB for memory; B, KB, MB for storage)
- **AND** status information uses standardized colors and symbols when supported
- **AND** description length is limited to maintain usable completion UI

#### Scenario: User-configurable description detail
- **WHEN** users interact with completion descriptions
- **THEN** description verbosity can be configured (minimal, standard, detailed)
- **AND** users can customize which metadata fields to include
- **AND** description preferences are stored per user/profile
- **AND** descriptions gracefully handle missing or unavailable metadata

### Requirement: Performance Optimization
The system SHALL ensure sub-200ms completion response times through optimization and intelligent caching.

#### Scenario: Response time requirements
- **WHEN** completion functions are invoked
- **THEN** cached data returns within 50ms
- **AND** fresh API calls complete within 200ms for small resource sets (<100 items)
- **AND** large resource sets use pagination and streaming for responsive UX
- **AND** timeout handling prevents hanging completions

#### Scenario: Request deduplication and batching
- **WHEN** multiple completion requests occur for the same resource type
- **THEN** duplicate requests within 1-second window are deduplicated
- **AND** batch API calls are used when fetching multiple resource types
- **AND** request coalescing reduces API call volume
- **AND** concurrent requests share results when possible

#### Scenario: Memory usage optimization
- **WHEN** caching large amounts of resource data
- **THEN** memory usage is bounded by configurable limits (default: 50MB)
- **AND** LRU eviction removes least recently used cache entries when limits are reached
- **AND** memory usage is monitored and reported in debug mode
- **AND** cache compression is applied for large resource datasets

### Requirement: Offline and Error Resilience
The system SHALL provide graceful degradation when AWS APIs are unavailable or when operating offline.

#### Scenario: Offline mode operation
- **WHEN** AWS API endpoints are unreachable
- **THEN** completion functions return available cached data
- **AND** cache age is indicated in completion descriptions when relevant
- **AND** offline mode is detected automatically based on connectivity
- **AND** user experience degrades gracefully without breaking functionality

#### Scenario: API error handling
- **WHEN** AWS API calls return errors (permissions, throttling, service issues)
- **THEN** error conditions are logged but don't break completion system
- **AND** cached data is used as fallback when available
- **AND** rate limiting is respected with exponential backoff
- **AND** permission errors result in empty completions rather than system errors

#### Scenario: Partial data handling
- **WHEN** API calls return partial data due to pagination or limits
- **THEN** available data is presented with indication of completeness
- **AND** most relevant results are prioritized in partial datasets
- **AND** pagination continues in background for complete data
