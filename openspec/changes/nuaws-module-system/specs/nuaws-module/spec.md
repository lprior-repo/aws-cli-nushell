# NuAWS Module System Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Unified Module Entry Point
The system SHALL provide a main `nuaws.nu` module that serves as the unified entry point for all AWS operations.

#### Scenario: Basic service routing
- **WHEN** user executes `nuaws s3 ls`
- **THEN** the main module routes the command to the s3 service module
- **AND** returns structured Nushell data

#### Scenario: Service discovery
- **WHEN** user executes `nuaws help`
- **THEN** the system displays all available AWS services
- **AND** shows operation counts for each service

#### Scenario: Invalid service handling
- **WHEN** user executes `nuaws invalid-service command`
- **THEN** the system returns a clear error message
- **AND** suggests available services

### Requirement: External Completion System
The system SHALL provide external completion functions for dynamic AWS resource discovery.

#### Scenario: Bucket name completion
- **WHEN** user types `nuaws s3 ls --bucket <TAB>`
- **THEN** the system provides completion for available S3 buckets
- **AND** completions are dynamically fetched from AWS

#### Scenario: Mock mode completions
- **WHEN** mock mode is enabled
- **AND** user requests completions
- **THEN** the system provides mock resource names
- **AND** completions work without AWS connectivity

#### Scenario: Context-aware completions
- **WHEN** user types `nuaws s3 get-object bucket-name <TAB>`
- **THEN** the system provides object completions specific to that bucket
- **AND** completions are filtered by the selected bucket context

### Requirement: Module Distribution Structure
The system SHALL organize code for easy distribution as a Nushell module.

#### Scenario: Single file distribution
- **WHEN** user downloads `nuaws.nu`
- **THEN** the module works independently
- **AND** includes all necessary components

#### Scenario: Git repository installation
- **WHEN** user clones the repository
- **AND** imports the main module
- **THEN** all services are immediately available
- **AND** completions are automatically registered

#### Scenario: Package manager compatibility
- **WHEN** module is installed via nupm or similar
- **THEN** the module follows standard Nushell packaging conventions
- **AND** dependencies are properly declared

### Requirement: Service Module Integration
The system SHALL integrate existing service modules with the unified interface.

#### Scenario: Backwards compatibility
- **WHEN** existing service modules are converted
- **THEN** all current functionality is preserved
- **AND** existing tests continue to pass

#### Scenario: Mock system preservation
- **WHEN** services are integrated with main module
- **THEN** mock mode functionality is maintained
- **AND** environment variable controls work as before

#### Scenario: Pipeline compatibility
- **WHEN** services are accessed through main module
- **THEN** pipeline integration works seamlessly
- **AND** data flows naturally between commands

### Requirement: Dynamic Service Loading
The system SHALL support on-demand loading of AWS service modules for performance optimization.

#### Scenario: Lazy service initialization
- **WHEN** user executes first command for a service
- **THEN** the service module is loaded on-demand
- **AND** subsequent commands use cached module

#### Scenario: Minimal startup overhead
- **WHEN** main module is imported
- **THEN** startup time is minimized
- **AND** only essential components are loaded initially

#### Scenario: Service metadata caching
- **WHEN** service information is requested
- **THEN** metadata is cached for performance
- **AND** cache invalidation works correctly

### Requirement: Enhanced Universal Generator
The system SHALL enhance the universal generator to produce module-compatible output.

#### Scenario: Module format generation
- **WHEN** generator creates service modules
- **THEN** output is compatible with main module system
- **AND** follows Nushell module conventions

#### Scenario: Completion function generation
- **WHEN** generator processes service schemas
- **THEN** external completion functions are automatically created
- **AND** completions are integrated with command signatures

#### Scenario: Documentation generation
- **WHEN** service modules are generated
- **THEN** comprehensive documentation is included
- **AND** help system integration is automatic
