# NuAWS Module System with External Completions

## Why

The current plugin-based approach requires binary compilation, but Nushell's module system with external completions provides a superior solution. A pure Nushell module system leverages the existing comprehensive codebase while providing the desired `nuaws s3 ls` syntax through natural Nushell patterns.

## What Changes

- **BREAKING**: Shift from binary plugin architecture to module-based system
- Create unified `nuaws.nu` module as main entry point
- Implement external completion system for dynamic AWS resource discovery
- Reorganize folder structure to support module distribution
- Transform existing service modules for unified interface
- Preserve all existing functionality (mock mode, testing, caching)

## Impact

- Affected specs: openapi-extraction (new module architecture requirements)
- Affected code: 
  - Complete reorganization of project structure
  - New `nuaws.nu` main module
  - Enhanced `universal_aws_generator.nu` for module output
  - Upgraded completion system in `plugin/core/external_completions.nu`
  - All existing service modules (`aws/*.nu`) 
  - Test framework integration
- Benefits:
  - No binary compilation required
  - Easy distribution via git/nupm
  - Leverages existing 555+ tests and sophisticated codebase
  - Natural Nushell module patterns
  - Dynamic completions with live AWS resource discovery
