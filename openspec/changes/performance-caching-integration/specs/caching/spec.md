# Caching System Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Multi-Level Cache Implementation
The system SHALL implement a three-tier cache hierarchy: memory → disk → network, where each level provides progressively slower access but larger capacity.

#### Scenario: Cache Hit Optimization
```nushell
# GIVEN a cache system is initialized
init-memory-cache

# AND data is stored in memory cache
store-in-memory "s3:us-east-1:bucket-list" $bucket_data

# WHEN the same data is requested
let result = cache-get "s3:us-east-1:bucket-list" {|| fetch-s3-buckets}

# THEN it returns from memory cache in <1ms
# AND no network call is made
# AND cache hit is recorded in metrics
```

#### Scenario: Cache Level Promotion
```nushell
# GIVEN data exists only in disk cache
store-in-disk "ec2:us-west-2:instances" $instance_data

# WHEN data is requested via cache-get
let result = cache-get "ec2:us-west-2:instances" {|| fetch-ec2-instances}

# THEN data is promoted to memory cache
# AND subsequent requests hit memory cache
# AND disk cache remains as backup
```

#### Scenario: Cache Miss Fallback
```nushell  
# GIVEN no cached data exists
# WHEN cache-get is called with a fetcher
let result = cache-get "lambda:us-east-1:functions" {|| fetch-lambda-functions}

# THEN the fetcher is executed
# AND result is stored in both memory and disk cache
# AND network call metrics are recorded
```

### Requirement: LRU Cache Eviction
The memory cache SHALL implement Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction when capacity limits are reached.

#### Scenario: LRU Eviction Under Pressure
```nushell
# GIVEN a memory cache with max_size = 3
$env.AWS_MEMORY_CACHE = {entries: {}, order: [], max_size: 3}

# WHEN 4 items are stored sequentially
store-in-memory "key1" "value1"
store-in-memory "key2" "value2" 
store-in-memory "key3" "value3"
store-in-memory "key4" "value4"

# THEN the oldest item (key1) is evicted
# AND memory cache contains exactly 3 items
# AND eviction order follows LRU policy
assert equal (get-from-memory "key1") null
assert equal ($env.AWS_MEMORY_CACHE.order | length) 3
```

### Requirement: Profile and Region Scoped Cache Keys
Cache keys SHALL include AWS profile and region to prevent cross-account/cross-region data contamination.

#### Scenario: Profile Isolation
```nushell
# GIVEN different profiles generate different cache keys
let prod_key = cache-key "s3" "ListBuckets" {} --profile "production" --region "us-east-1"
let dev_key = cache-key "s3" "ListBuckets" {} --profile "development" --region "us-east-1"

# THEN cache keys are different despite same service/operation/region
assert not equal $prod_key $dev_key

# AND cached data is isolated between profiles
store-in-memory $prod_key $prod_buckets
store-in-memory $dev_key $dev_buckets
assert not equal (get-from-memory $prod_key) (get-from-memory $dev_key)
```

#### Scenario: Region Isolation  
```nushell
# GIVEN different regions generate different cache keys
let east_key = cache-key "ec2" "DescribeInstances" {} --profile "prod" --region "us-east-1"  
let west_key = cache-key "ec2" "DescribeInstances" {} --profile "prod" --region "us-west-2"

# THEN cache keys are different despite same service/operation/profile
assert not equal $east_key $west_key
```

### Requirement: TTL-Based Cache Expiration
Cache entries SHALL support Time-To-Live (TTL) expiration with different policies based on resource type mutability.

#### Scenario: TTL Expiry Detection
```nushell
# GIVEN a cache entry with expired TTL
let old_timestamp = (date now) - 10min
$env.AWS_MEMORY_CACHE.entries = {
    "expired-key": {data: "old-value", timestamp: $old_timestamp}
}

# WHEN checking if entry is expired with 5min TTL
let is_expired = is-expired $old_timestamp 5min

# THEN entry is detected as expired
assert $is_expired

# AND cache-get triggers refresh
let result = cache-get "expired-key" {|| "fresh-value"} --ttl 5min
assert equal $result "fresh-value"
```

#### Scenario: Resource-Specific TTL Policy
```nushell
# GIVEN different resource types with appropriate TTL
let ami_ttl = get-resource-ttl "ec2" "DescribeImages"        # 24hr (immutable)
let policy_ttl = get-resource-ttl "iam" "ListPolicies"      # 1hr (rarely changed)  
let instance_ttl = get-resource-ttl "ec2" "DescribeInstances" # 5min (frequently changed)

# THEN TTLs match resource mutability patterns
assert ($ami_ttl > $policy_ttl)
assert ($policy_ttl > $instance_ttl)
```

### Requirement: Pattern-Based Cache Invalidation
The system SHALL support invalidating cache entries using glob patterns for selective cache clearing.

#### Scenario: Service-Wide Cache Invalidation
```nushell
# GIVEN cache entries for multiple services
store-in-memory "s3:us-east-1:bucket1" "value1"
store-in-memory "s3:us-east-1:bucket2" "value2"
store-in-memory "ec2:us-east-1:instance1" "value3"

# WHEN invalidating all S3 caches
invalidate-cache "s3:*"

# THEN only S3 entries are removed
assert equal (get-from-memory "s3:us-east-1:bucket1") null
assert equal (get-from-memory "s3:us-east-1:bucket2") null
assert not equal (get-from-memory "ec2:us-east-1:instance1") null
```

#### Scenario: Region-Specific Cache Invalidation
```nushell  
# GIVEN cache entries across multiple regions
store-in-memory "ec2:us-east-1:instances" $east_data
store-in-memory "ec2:us-west-2:instances" $west_data

# WHEN invalidating us-east-1 caches
invalidate-cache "*us-east-1*"

# THEN only us-east-1 entries are removed
assert equal (get-from-memory "ec2:us-east-1:instances") null
assert not equal (get-from-memory "ec2:us-west-2:instances") null
```

### Requirement: Compressed Disk Cache Storage
Disk cache entries SHALL be compressed using gzip to minimize storage footprint while maintaining performance.

#### Scenario: Disk Cache Compression Efficiency
```nushell
# GIVEN large data structure for caching
let large_data = 0..1000 | each {|i| {id: $i, data: ("x" | str repeat 100)}}

# WHEN storing in disk cache
store-in-disk "large-key" $large_data

# THEN compressed file is created
let cache_file = $"($env.HOME)/.cache/aws-nushell/large-key.json.gz"
assert (($cache_file | path exists))

# AND compression achieves significant size reduction
let compressed_size = (ls $cache_file | get 0.size)
let original_size = ($large_data | to json | str length)
assert ($compressed_size < ($original_size / 2))
```

### Requirement: Background Cache Warming
The system SHALL support background cache warming to pre-populate frequently accessed resources.

#### Scenario: Predictive Cache Warming
```nushell
# GIVEN a list of resources likely to be accessed
let resources = [
    {service: "s3", operation: "ListBuckets", params: {}},
    {service: "ec2", operation: "DescribeInstances", params: {}}
]

# WHEN warming cache in background
warm-cache $resources

# THEN resources are fetched asynchronously
# AND cache hit rate improves for subsequent access
# AND background operations don't block main thread
```

### Requirement: Cache Performance Metrics Integration
All cache operations SHALL integrate with the performance monitoring system to track hit rates, latencies, and effectiveness.

#### Scenario: Cache Hit Rate Tracking
```nushell
# GIVEN cache operations with hits and misses
cache-get "hit-key" {|| "hit-value"}    # Cache miss, then hit
cache-get "hit-key" {|| "hit-value"}    # Cache hit
cache-get "miss-key" {|| "miss-value"}  # Cache miss

# WHEN checking performance stats
let stats = aws perf stats

# THEN cache hit rates are accurately reported
let s3_stats = $stats | where operation == "s3:ListBuckets" | get 0
assert ($s3_stats.cache_hit_rate > 0)
assert ($s3_stats.cache_hit_rate <= 100)
```
