# Performance & Caching Architecture Design

## Design Philosophy

This design follows the project's core principles of pure functional programming, test-driven development, and pipeline-first architecture while introducing sophisticated performance optimizations. The implementation maintains zero-dependency generation capability and preserves the existing AWS CLI parity.

## Architectural Decisions

### 1. Multi-Level Cache Hierarchy

**Decision**: Implement memory → disk → network cache hierarchy with LRU eviction

**Rationale**:
- Memory cache provides sub-millisecond access for frequently used data
- Disk cache persists across sessions and provides middle-tier performance  
- Network fallback ensures no data loss while maintaining performance gains
- LRU eviction balances memory usage with hit rate optimization

**Trade-offs**:
- **Pros**: Optimal performance across different usage patterns, persistent cache
- **Cons**: Added complexity in cache consistency, disk I/O overhead
- **Alternative Considered**: Memory-only cache - rejected for lack of persistence

**Implementation Pattern**:
```nushell
# Cache retrieval follows strict hierarchy
cache-get key {|| fetch-operation} --ttl 5min
  ↓ Check memory cache (fastest)
  ↓ Check disk cache (medium) → promote to memory
  ↓ Execute fetcher (slowest) → store in both levels
```

### 2. Adaptive Concurrency Algorithm

**Decision**: Dynamic concurrency adjustment based on response latency

**Rationale**:
- Fixed concurrency doesn't adapt to varying AWS service response times
- Higher concurrency for fast operations maximizes throughput
- Lower concurrency for slow operations prevents timeout cascades
- Target latency provides clear optimization goal

**Trade-offs**:
- **Pros**: Self-optimizing performance, handles varying AWS service speeds
- **Cons**: Complex algorithm, potential oscillation in edge cases
- **Alternative Considered**: Fixed concurrency pools - rejected for inflexibility

**Implementation Pattern**:
```nushell
# Concurrency adapts based on actual performance
if $avg_latency < ($target_latency * 0.8) {
    $concurrency = ($concurrency * 1.5)  # Scale up for fast responses
} else if $avg_latency > ($target_latency * 1.2) {
    $concurrency = ($concurrency * 0.7)  # Scale down for slow responses
}
```

### 3. Request Deduplication Strategy

**Decision**: Time-window based deduplication with in-flight request tracking

**Rationale**:
- Multiple identical requests within short time windows are common
- In-flight tracking prevents duplicate network calls
- Time window balances efficiency with data freshness
- Supports both interactive and scripted usage patterns

**Trade-offs**:
- **Pros**: Eliminates redundant AWS API calls, improves efficiency
- **Cons**: Additional state management, potential for stale data
- **Alternative Considered**: Content-based deduplication - rejected for complexity

### 4. Streaming Pipeline Integration

**Decision**: Generator-based streaming with backpressure management

**Rationale**:
- AWS APIs return paginated results that can be massive (millions of S3 objects)
- Streaming prevents memory exhaustion while maintaining pipeline compatibility
- Backpressure prevents fast producers from overwhelming consumers
- Natural integration with Nushell's pipeline semantics

**Trade-offs**:
- **Pros**: Scales to unlimited dataset sizes, maintains pipeline semantics
- **Cons**: More complex than collect-all approach, requires careful memory management
- **Alternative Considered**: Chunked collection - rejected for memory limitations

### 5. Cache TTL Strategy

**Decision**: Resource-type based TTL with smart invalidation patterns

**Rationale**:
- AWS resources have different mutation frequencies
- Immutable resources (AMIs, snapshots) can be cached longer
- Frequently changing resources (EC2 instances) need shorter TTL
- Pattern-based invalidation allows selective cache clearing

**TTL Matrix**:
```
Resource Type          TTL      Justification
─────────────────────  ───────  ─────────────────────────
AMIs, Snapshots       24hr     Immutable after creation
IAM Policies          1hr      Rarely modified
S3 Buckets            1hr      Configuration changes rare  
EC2 Instances         5min     State changes frequently
CloudWatch Metrics    none     Real-time data required
```

### 6. Performance Monitoring Architecture

**Decision**: Built-in metrics collection with statistical analysis

**Rationale**:
- Performance optimization requires measurement
- Users need visibility into cache effectiveness
- Regression detection prevents performance degradation
- Statistics enable data-driven optimization decisions

**Metrics Collected**:
- Operation latency (p50, p95, p99)
- Cache hit rates by service/operation
- Request success/failure rates
- Memory and disk usage patterns

## Integration Patterns

### 1. Existing AWS Service Integration

**Challenge**: Add performance features without breaking existing operations

**Solution**: Decorator pattern with environment-based configuration
```nushell
# Existing operation remains unchanged
export def "aws s3 ls" [path: string] {
    # Performance layer wraps existing logic
    with-cache "s3:ls:$path" {|| aws-cli-call "s3" "ls" $path}
}

# New streaming variant is opt-in
export def "aws s3 ls" [path: string, --stream] {
    if $stream {
        stream-paginated "s3" "ListObjectsV2" {Bucket: $bucket}
    } else {
        aws s3 ls $path  # Falls back to existing implementation
    }
}
```

### 2. Test Framework Integration

**Challenge**: Maintain comprehensive testing with complex performance features

**Solution**: Layered testing with performance-specific test types
```nushell
# Unit tests for individual components
#[test]
def test_memory_cache_lru_eviction []

# Integration tests for complete workflows  
#[test]
def test_full_pipeline_with_cache []

# Performance tests with benchmarking
#[test]
def test_cache_hit_rate_under_load []

# Stress tests for reliability
#[test]  
def stress_sustained_throughput []
```

### 3. Mock Integration Strategy

**Challenge**: Performance features complicate existing mock system

**Solution**: Performance-aware mocking with realistic response times
```nushell
# Mock respects cache behavior
def get-mock-response [operation: string, params: record] -> record {
    let response = generate-mock-data $operation $params
    
    # Simulate realistic response times for performance testing
    if not $env.MOCK_INSTANT_RESPONSE? {
        let latency = get-realistic-latency $operation
        sleep $latency
    }
    
    $response | insert mock true
}
```

## Data Structure Design

### 1. Cache Entry Schema
```nushell
{
    data: any,           # Cached response data
    timestamp: datetime, # Creation time for TTL calculation
    ttl: duration,       # Time-to-live for this entry
    access_count: int,   # For LRU statistics
    size_bytes: int      # For memory management
}
```

### 2. Performance Metrics Schema
```nushell
{
    operation: string,     # "service:operation" format
    duration: duration,    # Request duration
    cache_hit: bool,       # Whether cache was used
    timestamp: datetime,   # When metric was recorded
    region: string,        # AWS region
    profile: string        # AWS profile
}
```

### 3. Request Signature Schema
```nushell
{
    service: string,       # AWS service name
    operation: string,     # Operation name
    params_hash: string,   # MD5 of parameters for uniqueness
    profile: string,       # AWS profile for scoping
    region: string         # AWS region for scoping
}
```

## Error Handling Strategy

### 1. Cache Failure Resilience
```nushell
# Cache failures never block operations
def cache-get [key: string, fetcher: closure] -> any {
    try {
        # Attempt cache retrieval
        let cached = get-from-cache $key
        if $cached != null { return $cached }
    } catch {
        # Cache failure logged but not blocking
        log warning $"Cache retrieval failed for ($key)"
    }
    
    # Always fallback to direct fetcher
    do $fetcher
}
```

### 2. Parallel Processing Error Handling
```nushell
# Configurable failure modes
export def batch-requests [
    requests: list,
    --fail-fast: bool = false  # Stop on first failure vs collect all
] -> list<record<request: record, result?: any, error?: string>> {
    $requests | par-each {|request|
        try {
            {request: $request, result: (execute-request $request)}
        } catch {|err|
            if $fail_fast { 
                error make {msg: $"Batch failed: ($err.msg)"} 
            }
            {request: $request, error: $err.msg}
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Resource Exhaustion Protection
```nushell
# Memory limits for cache
def store-in-memory [key: string, data: any] {
    # Check memory limits before storing
    if (get-memory-usage) > $MAX_MEMORY_USAGE {
        evict-lru-entries 10  # Free up space
    }
    
    # Size-aware storage
    let entry_size = ($data | to json | str length)
    if $entry_size > $MAX_ENTRY_SIZE {
        log warning $"Entry too large for memory cache: ($key)"
        return  # Skip memory storage
    }
    
    store-cache-entry $key $data
}
```

## Performance Optimization Decisions

### 1. Lazy Evaluation Strategy
**Decision**: Implement lazy evaluation with optional caching for expensive operations
**Benefit**: Only compute results when actually needed in pipeline
**Implementation**: Closure-based deferred execution

### 2. Connection Pooling
**Decision**: Pool connections by AWS service to reduce TLS handshake overhead
**Benefit**: Significant performance improvement for bulk operations
**Implementation**: Service-scoped connection reuse

### 3. Compression Strategy
**Decision**: Use gzip compression for disk cache entries
**Benefit**: Reduced disk usage (typically 50-70% size reduction)
**Trade-off**: CPU overhead for compression/decompression

## Future Extension Points

### 1. Pluggable Cache Backends
The cache interface allows future backends:
```nushell
export def cache-get [key: string, fetcher: closure] {
    match $env.CACHE_BACKEND? {
        "redis" => redis-cache-get $key $fetcher,
        "memcached" => memcached-cache-get $key $fetcher,
        _ => local-cache-get $key $fetcher
    }
}
```

### 2. Query Optimization Framework
Foundation for future SQL-like optimization:
```nushell
# Future: aws ec2 describe-instances | where region == "us-east-1" 
# Could be optimized to: aws ec2 describe-instances --filters '[{Name: "region", Values: ["us-east-1"]}]'
```

### 3. Machine Learning Integration
Performance data collection enables future ML optimization:
- Predictive cache warming based on usage patterns
- Intelligent prefetching of related resources
- Adaptive TTL based on observed mutation rates

This design provides a solid foundation for high-performance AWS operations while maintaining the project's architectural principles and extensibility for future enhancements.
