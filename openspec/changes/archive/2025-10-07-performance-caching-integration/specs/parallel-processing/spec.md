# Parallel Processing System Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Batch Request Processing with Concurrency Control
The system SHALL execute multiple AWS API requests in parallel with configurable concurrency limits and failure handling modes.

#### Scenario: Successful Parallel Request Execution
```nushell
# GIVEN a list of independent AWS requests
let requests = [
    {service: "s3", operation: "ListBuckets", params: {}},
    {service: "ec2", operation: "DescribeInstances", params: {}},
    {service: "lambda", operation: "ListFunctions", params: {}}
]

# WHEN executing requests in parallel with concurrency limit
let results = batch-requests $requests --concurrency 2

# THEN all requests complete successfully
assert equal ($results | length) 3
assert ($results | all {|r| "result" in $r})
assert ($results | all {|r| $r.result != null})

# AND total execution time is less than sequential time
# (assuming each request takes ~1sec, parallel should be ~2sec vs 3sec sequential)
```

#### Scenario: Partial Failure Handling with Resilient Mode
```nushell
# GIVEN a mix of valid and invalid requests
let requests = [
    {service: "s3", operation: "ListBuckets", params: {}},           # Valid
    {service: "invalid-service", operation: "BadOp", params: {}},    # Invalid  
    {service: "ec2", operation: "DescribeInstances", params: {}}     # Valid
]

# WHEN executing with resilient failure handling
let results = batch-requests $requests --concurrency 2 --fail-fast false

# THEN successful requests complete normally
let successes = $results | where error == null
assert equal ($successes | length) 2

# AND failed requests are captured with error details
let failures = $results | where error != null
assert equal ($failures | length) 1
assert ($failures.0.error | str contains "invalid-service")
```

#### Scenario: Fail-Fast Mode for Critical Workflows
```nushell
# GIVEN requests where one will fail immediately
let requests = [
    {service: "invalid-service", operation: "BadOp", params: {}},
    {service: "s3", operation: "ListBuckets", params: {}},
    {service: "ec2", operation: "DescribeInstances", params: {}}
]

# WHEN executing with fail-fast mode enabled
# THEN operation stops on first failure
try {
    batch-requests $requests --concurrency 1 --fail-fast true
    assert false "Should have failed fast"
} catch {|err|
    assert ($err.msg | str contains "Batch failed")
}
```

### Requirement: Request Deduplication Within Time Windows
The system SHALL detect and deduplicate identical requests within configurable time windows to prevent redundant API calls.

#### Scenario: Concurrent Request Deduplication
```nushell
# GIVEN an expensive operation that takes time to complete
mut execution_count = 0
let slow_operation = {|| 
    $execution_count = $execution_count + 1
    sleep 200ms  # Simulate network delay
    "expensive-result"
}

# WHEN multiple identical requests are made concurrently
let request_signature = "test-dedup-key"

# Start first request
let result1 = dedupe-request $request_signature $slow_operation

# Start second identical request while first is in-flight
let result2 = dedupe-request $request_signature $slow_operation

# THEN both requests return the same result
assert equal $result1 "expensive-result"
assert equal $result2 "expensive-result"

# AND the expensive operation executed only once
assert equal $execution_count 1
```

#### Scenario: Time Window Expiry for Fresh Data
```nushell
# GIVEN a request that was recently executed
let operation = {|| "fresh-data"}
let signature = "time-window-test"

# WHEN first request is made
let result1 = dedupe-request $signature $operation --window 100ms

# AND sufficient time passes for window expiry
sleep 150ms

# AND second request is made
let result2 = dedupe-request $signature $operation --window 100ms

# THEN second request executes fresh operation
# (Implementation would track this via execution counters)
```

### Requirement: Adaptive Concurrency Based on Response Times
The system SHALL automatically adjust concurrency levels based on observed response latencies to optimize throughput while avoiding service overload.

#### Scenario: Concurrency Increase for Fast Operations
```nushell
# GIVEN requests that respond quickly (under target latency)
let fast_requests = 0..100 | each {|i| {
    service: "s3",
    operation: "HeadObject", 
    params: {Bucket: "test-bucket", Key: $"fast-key-($i)"}
}}

# WHEN executing with adaptive concurrency
let results = adaptive-batch $fast_requests 
    --initial-concurrency 5 
    --target-latency 500ms

# THEN all requests complete successfully  
assert equal ($results | length) 100

# AND concurrency increased during execution
# (Implementation tracks concurrency changes for validation)
# AND average response time stays below target
```

#### Scenario: Concurrency Decrease for Slow Operations
```nushell
# GIVEN requests that respond slowly (above target latency)
let slow_requests = 0..20 | each {|i| {
    service: "slow-service",
    operation: "SlowOperation",
    params: {id: $i}
}}

# WHEN executing with adaptive concurrency  
let results = adaptive-batch $slow_requests
    --initial-concurrency 20
    --target-latency 100ms

# THEN concurrency decreases to prevent timeout cascades
# AND all requests eventually complete
assert equal ($results | length) 20

# AND system adapts to service constraints
```

### Requirement: Connection Pooling by Service
The system SHALL maintain connection pools grouped by AWS service to minimize TLS handshake overhead and improve bulk operation performance.

#### Scenario: Connection Reuse for Bulk Operations
```nushell
# GIVEN many requests to the same service
let s3_requests = 0..50 | each {|i| {
    service: "s3",
    operation: "ListObjectsV2",
    params: {Bucket: "test-bucket", Prefix: $"prefix-($i)"}
}}

# WHEN executing requests in parallel
let start_time = date now
let results = batch-requests $s3_requests --concurrency 10
let duration = (date now) - $start_time

# THEN connection pooling improves performance
# (Should be significantly faster than sequential due to connection reuse)
assert ($duration < 30sec)  # Reasonable time for 50 parallel requests
assert equal ($results | length) 50
```

### Requirement: Service-Grouped Request Batching  
Requests SHALL be grouped by AWS service to optimize connection pooling and allow service-specific optimizations.

#### Scenario: Service-Based Request Grouping
```nushell
# GIVEN requests for multiple services
let mixed_requests = [
    {service: "s3", operation: "ListBuckets", params: {}},
    {service: "s3", operation: "ListObjects", params: {Bucket: "test"}},
    {service: "ec2", operation: "DescribeInstances", params: {}},
    {service: "ec2", operation: "DescribeImages", params: {}},
    {service: "lambda", operation: "ListFunctions", params: {}}
]

# WHEN executing batch requests  
let results = batch-requests $mixed_requests --concurrency 3

# THEN requests are internally grouped by service
# AND each service group uses optimized connection pooling
# AND results maintain original request order correlation
assert equal ($results | length) 5
```

### Requirement: Parallel Processing Performance Monitoring
All parallel operations SHALL integrate with the performance monitoring system to track throughput, latency distribution, and concurrency effectiveness.

#### Scenario: Parallel Processing Metrics Collection
```nushell
# GIVEN parallel processing operations
# WHEN executing batch requests
let requests = [
    {service: "s3", operation: "ListBuckets", params: {}},
    {service: "ec2", operation: "DescribeRegions", params: {}}
]

let results = batch-requests $requests --concurrency 2

# THEN parallel processing metrics are recorded
let stats = aws perf stats
assert ($stats | length) >= 2  # At least one entry per service

# AND concurrency effectiveness is measurable
let s3_stats = $stats | where operation =~ "s3:" | get 0
assert ($s3_stats.avg_duration < 5sec)  # Reasonable parallel response time
```

### Requirement: Memory-Safe Parallel Execution
Parallel processing SHALL NOT exceed system memory limits and SHALL handle resource exhaustion gracefully.

#### Scenario: Memory Limit Enforcement
```nushell
# GIVEN a large number of memory-intensive requests
let large_requests = 0..1000 | each {|i| {
    service: "s3",
    operation: "ListObjectsV2", 
    params: {Bucket: "large-bucket", Prefix: $"large-prefix-($i)"}
}}

# WHEN executing with memory constraints
let initial_memory = (sys mem | get used)
let results = batch-requests $large_requests --concurrency 20
let peak_memory = (sys mem | get used)

# THEN memory usage stays within reasonable bounds
let memory_increase = $peak_memory - $initial_memory
assert ($memory_increase < 500MB)  # Should not consume excessive memory

# AND all requests complete despite large dataset
assert equal ($results | length) 1000
```

### Requirement: Error Correlation and Reporting
Failed parallel requests SHALL be properly correlated with their original request parameters for debugging and retry logic.

#### Scenario: Failed Request Correlation  
```nushell
# GIVEN a request that will fail with specific parameters
let failing_request = {
    service: "s3", 
    operation: "GetObject", 
    params: {Bucket: "nonexistent-bucket", Key: "nonexistent-key"}
}

let successful_request = {
    service: "s3",
    operation: "ListBuckets", 
    params: {}
}

# WHEN executing batch with mixed success/failure
let results = batch-requests [$failing_request, $successful_request] --fail-fast false

# THEN failed request maintains correlation to original parameters
let failure = $results | where error != null | get 0
assert equal $failure.request.service "s3"
assert equal $failure.request.operation "GetObject"
assert ($failure.request.params.Bucket == "nonexistent-bucket")

# AND error message provides actionable information
assert ($failure.error | str contains "NoSuchBucket" or ($failure.error | str contains "nonexistent"))
```
