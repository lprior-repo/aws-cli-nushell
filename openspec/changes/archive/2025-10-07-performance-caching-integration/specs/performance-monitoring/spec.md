# Performance Monitoring System Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Real-Time Metrics Collection
The system SHALL automatically collect performance metrics for all AWS operations including latency, cache hit rates, and success/failure statistics.

#### Scenario: Automatic Metrics Collection During Operations
```nushell
# GIVEN a clean metrics environment
$env.AWS_METRICS = []

# WHEN performing various AWS operations
aws s3 ls | ignore
aws ec2 describe-instances | ignore  
aws lambda list-functions | ignore

# THEN metrics are automatically collected
assert ($env.AWS_METRICS | length) >= 3

# AND each metric contains required fields
let metric = $env.AWS_METRICS | get 0
assert ("operation" in $metric)
assert ("duration" in $metric) 
assert ("cache_hit" in $metric)
assert ("timestamp" in $metric)
```

#### Scenario: Cache Hit Tracking Integration
```nushell
# GIVEN operations that use caching
# WHEN same operation is performed twice (cache miss then hit)
cache-get "test-key" {|| "test-value"} --ttl 1hr   # Cache miss
cache-get "test-key" {|| "test-value"} --ttl 1hr   # Cache hit

# THEN cache hit metrics are accurately recorded
let cache_miss = $env.AWS_METRICS | where cache_hit == false | length
let cache_hits = $env.AWS_METRICS | where cache_hit == true | length

assert ($cache_miss >= 1)
assert ($cache_hits >= 1)
```

### Requirement: Statistical Performance Analysis  
The system SHALL provide statistical analysis of performance metrics including percentile calculations (p50, p95, p99) and cache effectiveness analysis.

#### Scenario: Percentile Latency Calculations
```nushell
# GIVEN metrics with varying latencies
$env.AWS_METRICS = [
    {operation: "s3:ListBuckets", duration: 100ms, cache_hit: true, timestamp: (date now)},
    {operation: "s3:ListBuckets", duration: 150ms, cache_hit: true, timestamp: (date now)}, 
    {operation: "s3:ListBuckets", duration: 200ms, cache_hit: false, timestamp: (date now)},
    {operation: "s3:ListBuckets", duration: 500ms, cache_hit: false, timestamp: (date now)},
    {operation: "s3:ListBuckets", duration: 800ms, cache_hit: false, timestamp: (date now)}
]

# WHEN generating performance statistics
let stats = aws perf stats --operation "s3:ListBuckets"

# THEN statistical analysis is provided
let s3_stats = $stats | get 0
assert ($s3_stats.p50_duration >= 150ms)
assert ($s3_stats.p95_duration >= 500ms) 
assert ($s3_stats.p99_duration >= 800ms)

# AND cache hit rate is calculated
assert equal $s3_stats.count 5
assert equal $s3_stats.cache_hits 2
assert (($s3_stats.cache_hit_rate - 40.0) | math abs) < 1.0  # ~40% hit rate
```

#### Scenario: Time-Based Metrics Filtering
```nushell
# GIVEN metrics from different time periods  
let old_time = (date now) - 2hr
let recent_time = (date now) - 30min

$env.AWS_METRICS = [
    {operation: "test-op", duration: 100ms, cache_hit: true, timestamp: $old_time},
    {operation: "test-op", duration: 200ms, cache_hit: false, timestamp: $recent_time}
]

# WHEN filtering statistics by time window
let recent_stats = aws perf stats --since 1hr

# THEN only recent metrics are included  
let test_stats = $recent_stats | get 0
assert equal $test_stats.count 1  # Only recent metric
assert equal $test_stats.avg_duration 200ms
```

### Requirement: Operation Benchmarking Utilities
The system SHALL provide utilities for benchmarking specific operations with configurable iterations, warmup periods, and statistical analysis.

#### Scenario: Basic Operation Benchmarking
```nushell
# GIVEN a simple operation to benchmark
let simple_op = {|| sleep 10ms; "result"}

# WHEN benchmarking with iterations and warmup
let results = aws perf benchmark $simple_op --iterations 50 --warmup 5

# THEN comprehensive benchmark statistics are provided
assert equal $results.iterations 50
assert ($results.min >= 9ms)    # Close to expected 10ms
assert ($results.max <= 20ms)   # Should not be excessive
assert ($results.avg >= 10ms and $results.avg <= 15ms)
assert ($results.median >= 10ms and $results.median <= 12ms)
```

#### Scenario: Variable Latency Benchmarking  
```nushell
# GIVEN operation with variable performance (simulating AWS API variance)
let variable_op = {||
    let rand = (random int 0..100)
    if $rand < 90 {
        sleep 5ms   # 90% fast responses
    } else {
        sleep 50ms  # 10% slow responses 
    }
    "result"
}

# WHEN benchmarking variable operation
let results = aws perf benchmark $variable_op --iterations 100 --warmup 10

# THEN percentiles reflect the distribution
assert ($results.p95 > $results.median)  # P95 higher than median
assert ($results.p99 >= $results.p95)    # P99 highest
assert ($results.stddev > 1ms)           # Shows variability
```

### Requirement: Performance Regression Detection  
The system SHALL detect performance regressions by comparing current metrics against historical baselines and alerting when thresholds are exceeded.

#### Scenario: Regression Detection Through Metrics Analysis
```nushell
# GIVEN historical baseline performance
$env.AWS_METRICS = []

# Record baseline fast performance (simulating good performance period)
0..100 | each {|_| record-metric "baseline-op" 50ms true} | ignore

# Record recent degraded performance (simulating regression)  
0..50 | each {|_| record-metric "baseline-op" 200ms true} | ignore

# WHEN analyzing performance statistics  
let stats = aws perf stats --operation "baseline-op"

# THEN regression is detectable in the metrics
assert ($stats.avg_duration > 100ms)  # Average significantly higher
assert ($stats.p95_duration > 150ms)  # High percentiles show regression

# AND data supports regression analysis
assert ($stats.count > 100)  # Sufficient data for analysis
```

#### Scenario: Performance Baseline Comparison
```nushell
# GIVEN a performance baseline for comparison
let baseline_avg = 100ms
let baseline_p95 = 150ms

# WHEN current performance is measured
let current_stats = aws perf stats --operation "monitored-op" --since 1hr

# THEN regression thresholds can be evaluated
let current_avg = $current_stats.avg_duration  
let current_p95 = $current_stats.p95_duration

# Performance regression detected if current > baseline * 1.5
let avg_regression = ($current_avg > ($baseline_avg * 1.5))
let p95_regression = ($current_p95 > ($baseline_p95 * 1.5))

# AND alerts can be generated based on thresholds
if $avg_regression or $p95_regression {
    # Regression detected - alert mechanisms would trigger
}
```

### Requirement: Cache Effectiveness Analysis
The system SHALL analyze cache performance including hit rates, size efficiency, and eviction patterns to optimize cache configuration.

#### Scenario: Cache Hit Rate Analysis by Operation Type
```nushell
# GIVEN mixed cache performance across operations
$env.AWS_METRICS = [
    # S3 operations (typically high cache hit rate)
    {operation: "s3:ListBuckets", duration: 50ms, cache_hit: true, timestamp: (date now)},
    {operation: "s3:ListBuckets", duration: 45ms, cache_hit: true, timestamp: (date now)},
    {operation: "s3:ListBuckets", duration: 200ms, cache_hit: false, timestamp: (date now)},
    
    # EC2 operations (typically lower cache hit rate due to frequent changes)  
    {operation: "ec2:DescribeInstances", duration: 300ms, cache_hit: false, timestamp: (date now)},
    {operation: "ec2:DescribeInstances", duration: 280ms, cache_hit: false, timestamp: (date now)},
    {operation: "ec2:DescribeInstances", duration: 100ms, cache_hit: true, timestamp: (date now)}
]

# WHEN analyzing cache effectiveness by service
let stats = aws perf stats

# THEN service-specific cache patterns are visible
let s3_stats = $stats | where operation =~ "s3:" | get 0
let ec2_stats = $stats | where operation =~ "ec2:" | get 0

assert ($s3_stats.cache_hit_rate > $ec2_stats.cache_hit_rate)  # S3 caches better
assert ($s3_stats.avg_duration < $ec2_stats.avg_duration)     # Cache improves S3 performance
```

### Requirement: Real-Time Performance Dashboard  
The system SHALL provide real-time visibility into performance metrics through command-line interfaces that integrate with existing CLI workflows.

#### Scenario: Performance Statistics Summary Display
```nushell
# GIVEN accumulated performance metrics
# WHEN requesting performance summary
let summary = aws perf stats

# THEN readable statistics are displayed
assert ($summary | all {|stat| 
    "operation" in $stat and 
    "count" in $stat and 
    "cache_hit_rate" in $stat and
    "avg_duration" in $stat
})

# AND statistics are formatted for human consumption
# (Table format with appropriate units and precision)
```

#### Scenario: Live Performance Monitoring
```nushell
# GIVEN ongoing AWS operations  
# WHEN monitoring performance in real-time
let current_metrics = aws perf stats --since 5min

# THEN recent performance is immediately visible
# AND metrics reflect current system state
assert ($current_metrics | all {|m| 
    ($m.avg_duration > 0ms) and ($m.count >= 0)
})
```

### Requirement: Memory and Resource Usage Tracking
The system SHALL monitor memory usage, disk cache utilization, and other system resources to ensure performance optimizations don't cause resource exhaustion.

#### Scenario: Memory Usage Monitoring During Bulk Operations
```nushell
# GIVEN memory monitoring capabilities
let initial_memory = (sys mem | get used)

# WHEN performing memory-intensive operations  
let large_results = 0..10000 | each {|i| 
    cache-get $"bulk-key-($i)" {|| generate-test-data $i}
} | collect

let peak_memory = (sys mem | get used)
let memory_increase = $peak_memory - $initial_memory

# THEN memory usage stays within acceptable bounds
assert ($memory_increase < 200MB)  # Should not cause memory exhaustion

# AND cache system manages memory effectively
let cache_stats = get-cache-memory-stats
assert ($cache_stats.memory_usage < 100MB)
```

#### Scenario: Disk Cache Utilization Tracking
```nushell
# GIVEN disk cache monitoring
let cache_dir = $"($env.HOME)/.cache/aws-nushell"
let initial_disk_usage = (du $cache_dir | get apparent)

# WHEN using disk cache extensively
0..100 | each {|i| 
    store-in-disk $"disk-test-($i)" (generate-cache-data)
} | ignore

let final_disk_usage = (du $cache_dir | get apparent)
let disk_increase = $final_disk_usage - $initial_disk_usage

# THEN disk cache growth is reasonable
assert ($disk_increase > 0)      # Cache is being used
assert ($disk_increase < 50MB)   # But not growing excessively

# AND compression is effective
let compression_ratio = calculate-compression-effectiveness $cache_dir
assert ($compression_ratio > 0.5)  # At least 50% compression
```

### Requirement: Performance Export and Integration
The system SHALL support exporting performance metrics in standard formats for integration with external monitoring and analysis tools.

#### Scenario: Metrics Export in Standard Formats
```nushell
# GIVEN collected performance metrics  
# WHEN exporting metrics for external analysis
let exported_metrics = aws perf stats --format json

# THEN metrics are in machine-readable format  
assert ($exported_metrics | from json | length) > 0

# AND contain all required fields for analysis
let sample_metric = $exported_metrics | from json | get 0
assert ("operation" in $sample_metric)
assert ("avg_duration" in $sample_metric)
assert ("cache_hit_rate" in $sample_metric)
assert ("timestamp" in $sample_metric)
```

#### Scenario: Continuous Metrics Collection for Monitoring Integration
```nushell
# GIVEN a monitoring integration requirement
# WHEN metrics are collected over time
$env.AWS_METRICS = []

# Simulate sustained operations
0..50 | each {|i| 
    record-metric "monitoring-test" 100ms ($i mod 2 == 0)
    sleep 10ms
} | ignore

# THEN metrics contain temporal data suitable for monitoring systems
let time_series_data = $env.AWS_METRICS 
    | sort-by timestamp
    | window 10  # Group into time windows
    | each {|window| {
        time_bucket: ($window | get 0.timestamp | date to-record | get hour),
        avg_latency: ($window | get duration | math avg),
        hit_rate: (($window | where cache_hit | length) / ($window | length) * 100)
    }}

assert ($time_series_data | length) >= 1
assert ($time_series_data | all {|bucket| "avg_latency" in $bucket})
```
