# Pipeline Integration Capability Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Pipeline Native Data Structures
The system shall transform all AWS API responses into optimal Nushell data structures that seamlessly integrate with pipeline operations.

#### Scenario: Single Object Transformation
**Given** an AWS API returns a single resource object
**When** the response is processed by the pipeline transformer
**Then** the object is converted to a Nushell record with typed fields
**And** field names are converted from PascalCase to snake_case
**And** timestamps are converted to Nushell datetime objects
**And** byte sizes are converted to filesize objects
**And** computed fields are added for common operations

#### Scenario: Object List Transformation
**Given** an AWS API returns a list of resources
**When** the response is processed by the pipeline transformer
**Then** the list is converted to a Nushell table with typed columns
**And** each row represents a complete resource with all fields
**And** table structure is optimized for filtering and sorting operations
**And** related data is flattened appropriately for pipeline usage

#### Scenario: Mixed Data Structure Optimization
**Given** an AWS API returns complex nested data structures
**When** the response is processed by the pipeline transformer
**Then** nested objects are handled appropriately (flattened vs structured)
**And** arrays within objects are preserved as list columns
**And** metadata is separated from primary data for optional inclusion
**And** structure optimizes for the most common pipeline operations

#### Scenario: Computed Field Generation
**Given** AWS resources with derivable information
**When** computed fields are generated during transformation
**Then** file extensions are extracted from object keys
**And** directory paths are computed from full paths
**And** human-readable names are derived from ARNs and IDs
**And** age calculations are provided for time-based resources

### Requirement: Functional Programming Patterns
The system shall provide higher-order functions and combinators that enable functional composition of AWS operations following pure functional programming principles.

#### Scenario: AWS Resource Mapping
**Given** a collection of AWS resources
**When** transformation is applied using aws_map function
**Then** transformations are applied purely without side effects
**And** original data is preserved immutably
**And** transformations compose naturally with other operations
**And** lazy evaluation is used for expensive transformations

#### Scenario: Resource Filtering with Predicates
**Given** AWS resources and filtering criteria
**When** aws_filter function is applied with predicates
**Then** filtering preserves original data structure
**And** predicates are pure functions without side effects
**And** multiple filters compose logically (and/or operations)
**And** performance is optimized through early termination

#### Scenario: Data Aggregation and Reduction
**Given** AWS resources requiring aggregation
**When** aws_reduce function is applied
**Then** aggregation functions maintain referential transparency
**And** partial results are composable for incremental processing
**And** reduction maintains type safety throughout the process
**And** memory usage is optimized for large datasets

#### Scenario: Cross-Service Data Correlation
**Given** resources from multiple AWS services
**When** correlate_with function is used
**Then** relationships are established without modifying source data
**And** correlation keys are automatically inferred when possible
**And** missing relationships are handled gracefully
**And** correlated data maintains clear provenance information

### Requirement: Advanced Error Handling System
The system shall provide Nushell-native error handling with comprehensive span information, actionable suggestions, and interactive resolution capabilities.

#### Scenario: Span-Aware Error Generation
**Given** an AWS operation fails with specific input parameters
**When** an error is generated
**Then** the error includes precise source location highlighting
**And** parameter span information is preserved from user input
**And** error location maps to original command syntax
**And** multiple error locations are supported for complex failures

#### Scenario: AWS Error Code Mapping
**Given** AWS returns service-specific error codes
**When** errors are mapped to user-friendly messages
**Then** all AWS error codes have corresponding friendly explanations
**And** error messages include contextual information about the failure
**And** technical AWS error details are available but not prominent
**And** error mapping accounts for service-specific terminology

#### Scenario: Actionable Error Suggestions
**Given** common AWS operational errors
**When** suggestion generation is triggered
**Then** specific next steps are provided for error resolution
**And** suggestions account for current AWS configuration context
**And** alternative approaches are suggested when applicable
**And** suggestions include example commands for resolution

#### Scenario: Interactive Error Resolution
**Given** an error that supports guided resolution
**When** interactive resolution is initiated
**Then** step-by-step guidance is provided to fix the issue
**And** current AWS state is checked before each resolution step
**And** progress is tracked and resumable if interrupted
**And** resolution success is verified after completion

#### Scenario: Error Context Preservation
**Given** AWS operations that maintain request metadata
**When** errors occur during operations
**Then** AWS request IDs are preserved for support escalation
**And** operation context (service, operation, parameters) is maintained
**And** timing information is available for performance analysis
**And** retry information is tracked for debugging

### Requirement: Pure Function Architecture
The system shall maintain functional programming principles throughout all data transformations and operations.

#### Scenario: Side Effect Isolation
**Given** operations that interact with external systems
**When** functions are designed for composition
**Then** side effects are isolated to clearly marked boundaries
**And** pure transformations are separated from IO operations
**And** function signatures clearly indicate side effect presence
**And** composition maintains purity guarantees

#### Scenario: Immutable Data Transformations
**Given** data transformation operations
**When** transformations are applied to AWS data
**Then** original data structures are never modified
**And** all transformations return new data structures
**And** transformation chains maintain immutability
**And** performance is optimized through structural sharing

#### Scenario: Function Composition Validation
**Given** multiple AWS operations to be composed
**When** composition is attempted
**Then** type compatibility is verified at composition time
**And** composition follows associative properties
**And** composed functions maintain error handling properties
**And** composition performance is optimized through fusion

#### Scenario: Lazy Evaluation Support
**Given** expensive AWS operations or large datasets
**When** lazy evaluation is employed
**Then** computation is deferred until results are needed
**And** intermediate results are cached appropriately
**And** lazy evaluation is transparent to user operations
**And** memory usage is optimized through demand-driven computation

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Enhanced Response Processing (extends existing transformation)
The existing AWS response processing shall be enhanced to support the new pipeline-native data structures.

#### Scenario: Backward Compatibility
**Given** existing nuaws commands that return structured data
**When** enhanced pipeline transformations are applied
**Then** existing command behavior is preserved
**And** new pipeline features are available as enhancements
**And** migration path is provided for advanced features
**And** performance is equal or better than existing implementation

## Cross-Reference Notes

This pipeline integration capability builds upon:
- **Core Infrastructure**: Type system and service modules provide foundation
- **Performance Streaming**: Pipeline structures enable efficient streaming
- **Service Enhancements**: Functional patterns support service-specific features

This capability enables:
- Natural Nushell idioms for AWS operations
- Composition of complex workflows through pipelines
- Predictable error handling across all operations
- Performance optimization through functional design
