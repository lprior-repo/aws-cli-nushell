# Core Infrastructure Capability Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Project Structure Generator
The system shall provide automated project structure generation for consistent NuAWS deployments.

#### Scenario: New Project Initialization
**Given** a user wants to create a new NuAWS project
**When** they run the project structure generator
**Then** a complete directory structure is created with:
- `modules/` directory for pre-generated service modules
- `completions/` directory for external completion functions  
- `schemas/` directory for AWS service schemas
- `nuaws/` directory for build-time components
- `tests/` directory for comprehensive test suites
- `docs/` directory for generated documentation
- Essential files: `build.nu`, `nuaws.nu`, `mod.nu`, `.gitignore`, `README.md`

#### Scenario: Structure Validation
**Given** an existing NuAWS project
**When** the structure validation runs
**Then** all required directories and files are verified
**And** syntax validation passes for all generated files
**And** missing components are reported with remediation suggestions

### Requirement: Enhanced Build System
The system shall provide a comprehensive build pipeline that generates all service modules from AWS schemas with parallel processing and validation.

#### Scenario: Parallel Service Generation
**Given** multiple AWS service schemas in the schemas directory
**When** the build system runs with parallel processing
**Then** services are generated concurrently based on system capabilities
**And** build time is significantly reduced compared to sequential processing
**And** all generated modules pass syntax and semantic validation
**And** progress reporting shows real-time generation status

#### Scenario: Incremental Build Detection
**Given** a previously successful build
**When** only specific schemas have changed
**Then** only affected services are regenerated
**And** unchanged services are preserved from previous build
**And** build time is minimized through selective regeneration
**And** dependency tracking ensures consistency

#### Scenario: Build Validation Pipeline
**Given** service modules have been generated
**When** the validation pipeline executes
**Then** all modules pass Nushell syntax validation
**And** type annotations are verified for correctness
**And** completion annotations are validated
**And** error handling coverage is confirmed
**And** mock mode functionality is tested

### Requirement: Advanced Service Module Generator
The system shall generate complete Nushell service modules with comprehensive type safety, completions, and error handling.

#### Scenario: Type-Safe Function Generation
**Given** an AWS service schema with operation definitions
**When** the service module generator processes the schema
**Then** each operation generates a type-safe Nushell function
**And** parameter types are mapped from AWS schemas to Nushell types
**And** return types are annotated for pipeline optimization
**And** optional parameters are handled with appropriate defaults

#### Scenario: Custom Completion Generation
**Given** AWS service operations with parameter definitions
**When** completion annotations are generated
**Then** each parameter has appropriate completion behavior
**And** resource-based parameters include dynamic completion
**And** enum parameters include all valid choices
**And** contextual completions account for dependent parameters

#### Scenario: Error Handling Integration
**Given** AWS service operations that can fail
**When** error handling code is generated
**Then** all AWS error codes are mapped to friendly messages
**And** error messages include span information for highlighting
**And** actionable suggestions are provided for common errors
**And** AWS request IDs and metadata are preserved

### Requirement: Comprehensive Type System
The system shall provide robust type mapping and validation from AWS schemas to Nushell types with constraint enforcement.

#### Scenario: AWS Type Mapping
**Given** AWS schema type definitions
**When** type mappings are generated
**Then** primitive types map correctly (string→string, integer→int, boolean→bool)
**And** timestamp types convert to Nushell datetime
**And** blob types map to binary data
**And** complex types generate appropriate record structures
**And** list types preserve element type information

#### Scenario: Constraint Validation
**Given** AWS parameters with constraints (min/max, patterns, enums)
**When** validation functions are generated
**Then** numeric constraints are enforced with clear error messages
**And** string patterns are validated using regex
**And** enum values are verified against allowed choices
**And** constraint violations provide guidance for resolution

#### Scenario: Custom Type Construction
**Given** complex AWS resources (S3Object, EC2Instance, LambdaFunction)
**When** custom type constructors are created
**Then** types include all relevant fields from AWS schemas
**And** computed fields are added for common operations
**And** type constructors are optimized for Nushell pipeline usage
**And** custom types support equality and comparison operations

### Requirement: Dynamic Completion System
The system shall provide intelligent, context-aware completions for AWS resources with caching and offline support.

#### Scenario: Dynamic Resource Completion
**Given** a user typing an AWS command requiring resource selection
**When** tab completion is triggered
**Then** live AWS resources are fetched and presented
**And** completion response time is under 200ms
**And** results are scoped to current profile and region
**And** error handling gracefully manages AWS API failures

#### Scenario: Intelligent Caching
**Given** resource completions have been requested previously
**When** the same completion is triggered again
**Then** cached results are returned if within TTL
**And** cache hit rate exceeds 90% for repeated operations
**And** background refresh keeps cache current
**And** cache eviction handles memory constraints

#### Scenario: Context-Aware Completions
**Given** AWS operations with dependent parameters
**When** contextual completion is requested
**Then** completion options are filtered based on previous parameters
**And** bucket-specific objects are shown for S3 operations
**And** VPC-specific resources are shown for EC2 operations
**And** cross-service dependencies are resolved correctly

#### Scenario: Offline Fallback
**Given** network connectivity issues prevent AWS API access
**When** completion is requested
**Then** cached values are used when available
**And** static enum values are always available
**And** clear indication is given when completions may be stale
**And** functionality degrades gracefully without crashing

## Cross-Reference Notes

This core infrastructure capability provides the foundation for:
- **Pipeline Integration**: Type-safe data structures enable optimal pipeline transformations
- **Performance Streaming**: Build system generates streaming-capable functions
- **Service Enhancements**: Modular architecture supports service-specific features

Dependencies on existing components:
- Current `build.nu` system for enhancement baseline
- Existing `nuaws.nu` router for integration
- `nutest` framework for comprehensive testing
- AWS schemas in `schemas/` directory for processing input
