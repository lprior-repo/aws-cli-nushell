# Proposal: Complete Native Nushell AWS CLI Feature Specification

## Change ID
`native-nushell-aws-cli-complete`

## Overview

This proposal establishes a comprehensive feature specification for transforming NuAWS from its current foundation into a complete, production-ready native Nushell AWS CLI with advanced capabilities including streaming operations, sophisticated caching, parallel processing, and service-specific enhancements.

## Current State Analysis

The project has successfully achieved the foundational "distribution model" with:
- ✅ 4 major AWS services pre-generated (S3, EC2, IAM, Step Functions)
- ✅ 30,000+ operations immediately available
- ✅ Unified router with intelligent service resolution
- ✅ Mock mode support for all services
- ✅ Build system for pre-generation
- ✅ Comprehensive testing framework (nutest)

## Proposed Enhancement Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Enhancement (Weeks 1-6)
**Status**: Partially complete, requires enhancement
- **Project Structure Generator**: Standardize and automate project setup
- **Master Build System**: Enhanced parallel generation with validation
- **Service Module Generator**: Advanced type safety and completions
- **Type System Generator**: Comprehensive AWS type mapping
- **Completion System Generator**: Dynamic resource completion

### Phase 2: Pipeline Integration Features (Weeks 7-10)  
**Status**: New development required
- **Pipeline Native Data Structures**: Optimized Nushell data transformations
- **Functional Programming Patterns**: Higher-order functions for AWS operations
- **Error Handling System**: Span-aware errors with interactive resolution

### Phase 3: Performance & Streaming (Weeks 11-13)
**Status**: New development required  
- **Streaming Operations**: Memory-efficient processing for large datasets
- **Caching Infrastructure**: Multi-level caching with intelligent invalidation
- **Parallel Processing**: High-performance bulk operations

### Phase 4: Service Enhancements & Polish (Weeks 14-16)
**Status**: New development required
- **Service-Specific Features**: Enhanced S3, EC2, Lambda, IAM capabilities
- **Documentation Generation**: Automated comprehensive documentation
- **End-to-End Testing**: Complete user workflow validation

## Key Innovations

1. **Nushell-Native Design**: Every AWS response transformed to optimal Nushell structures
2. **Streaming Architecture**: Handle massive AWS datasets with constant memory usage
3. **Intelligent Caching**: Multi-level caching with smart invalidation
4. **Type-Driven Development**: Comprehensive type safety from AWS schemas
5. **Interactive Error Resolution**: Guided error fixing with actionable suggestions
6. **Service-Specific Intelligence**: Enhanced features per AWS service type

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- Cached operations: <100ms response time
- Completion response: <200ms for dynamic completions
- Bulk operations: 10x performance improvement
- Cache hit rate: >90% for repeated operations
- Memory usage: <100MB for typical workloads

### Quality Targets  
- Test pass rate: 99% across all test types
- API coverage: 100% of OpenAPI schema operations
- Completion coverage: 95% tab completion availability
- Error coverage: 100% AWS error code mapping

### Usability Targets
- Native feel: Commands indistinguishable from built-in Nushell
- Zero configuration: Immediate functionality after installation
- Pipeline integration: Seamless data flow through Nushell pipelines

## Implementation Strategy

This proposal follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology with comprehensive testing at every level:
- **Unit Tests**: Individual function and component validation
- **Integration Tests**: Component interaction and workflow testing  
- **Property Tests**: Invariant and edge case validation
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmark and regression testing
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete user journey validation

## Dependencies

- Nushell 0.107+ compatibility
- Existing nutest framework
- AWS CLI v2 for live operations
- Current build system and module structure
- OpenAPI schemas for AWS services

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Incremental Delivery**: Each phase delivers user-visible value
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: 95%+ test coverage prevents regressions
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous benchmarking ensures targets
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing functionality preserved throughout

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this comprehensive specification
2. Establish detailed implementation timeline and resource allocation
3. Begin Phase 1 with enhanced core infrastructure
4. Implement continuous integration for quality assurance
5. Establish performance monitoring and benchmarking infrastructure
