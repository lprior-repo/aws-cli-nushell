## Dependencies and Parallelization

### Parallel Tracks
- **Track A**: Core infrastructure (1.1-1.4) → Service implementation (3.1-3.4)
- **Track B**: Generator enhancement (2.1-2.4) → Pipeline integration (4.1-4.4)  
- **Track C**: Testing and documentation (1.4, 5.1-5.4) throughout all phases

### Critical Path Dependencies
1. Plugin entry point system → Service module loading → Service generation
2. External completion framework → Completion generation → Resource completions
3. Generator enhancement → Service implementation → Performance optimization
4. Core infrastructure → Pipeline integration → Quality assurance

### Risk Mitigation
