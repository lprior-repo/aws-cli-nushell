# Pipeline Integration Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Native Nushell Data Type Integration
The system SHALL seamlessly integrate with Nushell's native data types and pipeline operations.

#### Scenario: Table-First Return Types
- **Given** an AWS operation returns a list of resources
- **When** the operation is executed through nuaws
- **Then** results are returned as native Nushell tables
- **And** column types are properly specified (string, int, datetime, etc.)
- **And** table operations (select, where, sort-by) work naturally

#### Scenario: Native Type Conversion
- **Given** AWS responses contain timestamps and sizes
- **When** data is processed by nuaws
- **Then** timestamps are converted to Nushell datetime type
- **And** sizes are converted to Nushell filesize type
- **And** durations are converted to Nushell duration type

#### Scenario: Pipeline Chaining
- **Given** a user wants to filter and transform AWS data
- **When** they chain nuaws commands with Nushell operations
- **Then** `nuaws s3 list-objects | where size > 1MB | sort-by modified | first 10` works naturally
- **And** all intermediate results maintain proper typing
- **And** performance is optimized for pipeline operations

### Requirement: Cross-Service Pipeline Workflows
The system SHALL support complex workflows that span multiple AWS services through pipeline composition.

#### Scenario: Multi-Service Resource Discovery
- **Given** a user wants to find EC2 instances in specific VPCs
- **When** they compose operations across services
- **Then** `nuaws ec2 describe-vpcs | get vpc_id | each { |vpc| nuaws ec2 describe-instances --filters [{name: "vpc-id", values: [$vpc]}] } | flatten` works correctly
- **And** resource relationships are preserved across services
- **And** batch operations are optimized for performance

#### Scenario: Resource Lifecycle Management
- **Given** a user wants to manage resources across services
- **When** they create workflows like IAM role → Lambda function → API Gateway
- **Then** each step receives proper input from previous operations
- **And** error handling preserves workflow context
- **And** rollback information is available for failed operations

#### Scenario: Bulk Operations with Error Handling
- **Given** a user wants to perform bulk operations
- **When** they process multiple resources through pipelines
- **Then** individual failures don't stop the entire pipeline
- **And** error details are preserved for failed items
- **And** successful operations continue processing

### Requirement: Error Handling in Pipeline Context
The system SHALL provide structured error handling that integrates naturally with Nushell pipelines.

#### Scenario: Structured Error Objects
- **Given** an AWS operation fails in a pipeline
- **When** the error is processed
- **Then** error information is available as structured data
- **And** error objects can be filtered and processed in pipelines
- **And** partial results are preserved when possible

#### Scenario: Error Recovery Patterns
- **Given** operations may fail with retryable errors
- **When** errors occur in pipeline context
- **Then** automatic retry mechanisms are applied where appropriate
- **And** retry attempts are transparent to pipeline flow
- **And** final failures provide actionable error information

#### Scenario: Pipeline Error Aggregation
- **Given** bulk operations produce multiple errors
- **When** pipeline completes with some failures
- **Then** errors are aggregated in useful format
- **And** successful operations are clearly distinguished
- **And** error summary provides actionable insights

### Requirement: Performance Optimization for Pipelines
The system SHALL optimize performance for common pipeline usage patterns.

#### Scenario: Streaming Large Results
- **Given** AWS operations return large datasets
- **When** results are processed in pipelines
- **Then** streaming tables are used to avoid memory issues
- **And** pipeline operations can begin before all data is loaded
- **And** memory usage remains constant regardless of dataset size

#### Scenario: Parallel Operation Execution
- **Given** pipeline operations can be parallelized
- **When** independent operations are executed
- **Then** parallel execution is used automatically
- **And** thread safety is maintained throughout
- **And** results are properly synchronized

#### Scenario: Smart Caching for Pipeline Performance
- **Given** repeated operations occur in pipelines
- **When** similar requests are made
- **Then** cached results are used when appropriate
- **And** cache invalidation maintains data consistency
- **And** cache hits significantly improve pipeline performance

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Enhanced Mock Mode for Pipeline Testing
The existing mock system SHALL support realistic pipeline testing scenarios.

#### Scenario: Pipeline Mock Consistency
- **Given** mock mode is enabled for pipeline testing
- **When** complex workflows are executed
- **Then** mock responses maintain consistency across operations
- **And** resource relationships are preserved in mock data
- **And** realistic data volumes are provided for performance testing

#### Scenario: Pipeline Error Simulation
- **Given** pipeline error scenarios need testing
- **When** mock mode is configured for error simulation
- **Then** realistic error conditions can be simulated
- **And** error recovery mechanisms can be tested
- **And** partial failure scenarios are supported

### Requirement: Configuration Impact on Pipelines
The existing configuration system SHALL support pipeline-specific optimizations.

#### Scenario: Pipeline Performance Configuration
- **Given** users have different performance requirements
- **When** pipeline operations are configured
- **Then** batch sizes can be tuned for optimal performance
- **And** parallelism levels can be adjusted
- **And** caching strategies can be customized

#### Scenario: Pipeline Debugging Configuration
- **Given** users need to debug complex pipelines
- **When** debugging is enabled
- **Then** intermediate results can be logged
- **And** timing information is available for each step
- **And** resource usage can be monitored

## REMOVED Requirements

None. This specification enhances pipeline integration without removing existing functionality.
