# External Completion Engine Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Dynamic AWS Resource Completions
The system SHALL provide real-time AWS resource completions for all command parameters that reference AWS resources.

#### Scenario: S3 Bucket Completion
- **Given** a user is typing an S3 command with bucket parameter
- **When** they press Tab after `nuaws s3 get-object `
- **Then** the system displays available S3 buckets as completion options
- **And** buckets are fetched from current AWS account/region
- **And** results are cached for performance (5-minute TTL)

#### Scenario: Context-Aware Object Completion
- **Given** a user has specified a bucket name
- **When** they press Tab for the object key parameter
- **Then** the system displays objects in that specific bucket
- **And** completions are filtered to match current input prefix
- **And** results are limited to 50 items for performance

#### Scenario: Cross-Service Resource Completion
- **Given** a user is configuring IAM policy with S3 resources
- **When** they specify an S3 ARN parameter
- **Then** the system provides completions for S3 bucket ARNs
- **And** ARN format is automatically applied
- **And** cross-service dependencies are resolved

### Requirement: Completion Performance Optimization
The system SHALL optimize completion performance through caching and intelligent prefetching.

#### Scenario: Completion Result Caching
- **Given** completion results have been fetched recently
- **When** the same completion is requested again
- **Then** cached results are returned immediately
- **And** cache TTL is appropriate for resource type (5min for dynamic, 1hr for static)
- **And** cache is invalidated on AWS configuration changes

#### Scenario: Background Completion Warming
- **Given** a user frequently uses certain AWS services
- **When** the plugin is loaded
- **Then** common completions are pre-warmed in background
- **And** user experience is not impacted by warming
- **And** warming respects AWS API rate limits

#### Scenario: Graceful Completion Fallback
- **Given** AWS API calls fail for completion data
- **When** completion is requested
- **Then** system falls back to cached data if available
- **And** provides helpful error message if no cache exists
- **And** continues working for other completion types

### Requirement: Completion Type System
The system SHALL support multiple completion types with appropriate formatting and metadata.

#### Scenario: Simple String Completions
- **Given** a parameter needs basic string completions
- **When** completion is triggered
- **Then** returns list of strings for simple selection
- **And** supports prefix filtering
- **And** displays quickly without additional metadata

#### Scenario: Rich Completion with Descriptions
- **Given** a parameter benefits from additional context
- **When** completion is triggered
- **Then** returns records with value and description fields
- **And** displays resource details (e.g., instance state, creation date)
- **And** allows selection by value while showing context

#### Scenario: Hierarchical Resource Completions
- **Given** resources have parent-child relationships
- **When** completion is triggered
- **Then** displays resources in logical hierarchy
- **And** allows drilling down through resource tree
- **And** maintains context of parent resource selection

### Requirement: Completion Function Generation
The system SHALL automatically generate completion functions for AWS resources based on service schemas.

#### Scenario: Automatic Completion Discovery
- **Given** an AWS service schema with resource references
- **When** a service module is generated
- **Then** appropriate completion functions are created
- **And** resource relationships are identified and mapped
- **And** completion functions are registered with parameter types

#### Scenario: Custom Completion Patterns
- **Given** specific AWS resource types with known patterns
- **When** completion functions are generated
- **Then** optimized completion logic is applied
- **And** common resource filters are pre-configured
- **And** performance optimizations are included

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Mock Mode Completion Support
The existing mock system SHALL provide realistic completion data for testing and development.

#### Scenario: Mock Resource Completions
- **Given** mock mode is enabled for a service
- **When** completions are requested for that service
- **Then** realistic mock resource names are provided
- **And** mock data follows AWS naming conventions
- **And** mock completions are consistent across sessions

#### Scenario: Mixed Mock/Real Completions
- **Given** some services are in mock mode and others are not
- **When** completions span multiple services
- **Then** mock data is used for mock services
- **And** real data is used for non-mock services
- **And** completion behavior is clearly indicated

### Requirement: Performance Monitoring Integration
The completion system SHALL integrate with existing performance monitoring for optimization.

#### Scenario: Completion Performance Metrics
- **Given** completion operations are executed
- **When** performance metrics are collected
- **Then** completion timing and cache hit rates are tracked
- **And** slow completions are identified and optimized
- **And** AWS API usage for completions is monitored

## REMOVED Requirements

None. This specification extends the system without removing existing functionality.
