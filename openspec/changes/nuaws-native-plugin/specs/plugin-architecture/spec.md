# Plugin Architecture Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Unified Entry Point System
The system SHALL provide a single `nuaws` command that serves as the entry point for all AWS operations.

#### Scenario: Basic Service Routing
- **Given** a user wants to execute an S3 operation
- **When** they run `nuaws s3 list-buckets`
- **Then** the system routes to the S3 service module and executes `list-buckets`
- **And** returns results in native Nushell table format

#### Scenario: Service Discovery
- **Given** a user wants to see available services
- **When** they run `nuaws help` or `nuaws` without arguments
- **Then** the system displays all available AWS services with descriptions
- **And** includes usage examples for each service

#### Scenario: Dynamic Service Loading
- **Given** a service module doesn't exist locally
- **When** a user requests that service (e.g., `nuaws lambda list-functions`)
- **Then** the system automatically generates the service module
- **And** caches it for subsequent use
- **And** executes the requested operation

### Requirement: Service Module Interface
The system SHALL define a consistent interface for all AWS service modules to ensure uniform behavior.

#### Scenario: Module Contract Compliance
- **Given** a generated AWS service module
- **When** the module is loaded by the plugin system
- **Then** it exposes all operations as exportable functions
- **And** follows consistent naming conventions (kebab-case)
- **And** provides standardized error handling

#### Scenario: Module Metadata
- **Given** a loaded service module
- **When** queried for metadata
- **Then** it provides service name, version, operation count
- **And** includes generation timestamp and AWS schema version
- **And** lists all available operations with descriptions

### Requirement: Configuration Management
The system SHALL provide centralized configuration management for AWS credentials, regions, and plugin settings.

#### Scenario: Global Configuration
- **Given** a user sets AWS configuration
- **When** they run `nuaws config set aws.region us-west-2`
- **Then** all subsequent operations use that region
- **And** the setting persists across sessions
- **And** can be overridden per-operation with `--region`

#### Scenario: Service-Specific Configuration
- **Given** a user wants S3-specific settings
- **When** they run `nuaws config set s3.default_bucket my-bucket`
- **Then** S3 operations use that bucket as default when not specified
- **And** other services are not affected
- **And** the setting can be viewed with `nuaws config get s3`

### Requirement: Error Handling and Validation
The system SHALL provide consistent error handling across all services with actionable error messages.

#### Scenario: Invalid Service Name
- **Given** a user requests a non-existent service
- **When** they run `nuaws invalidservice some-operation`
- **Then** the system displays an error with available services
- **And** suggests the closest matching service name
- **And** provides help on service discovery

#### Scenario: AWS Credential Errors
- **Given** AWS credentials are invalid or missing
- **When** a user attempts any AWS operation
- **Then** the system provides clear credential setup instructions
- **And** suggests using `aws configure` or environment variables
- **And** offers mock mode for testing without credentials

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Testing Framework Integration
The existing nutest framework SHALL be extended to support plugin-specific testing patterns.

#### Scenario: Plugin Component Testing
- **Given** a plugin component needs testing
- **When** tests are executed with `nutest run-tests --path plugin/tests`
- **Then** all plugin components are tested using standard patterns
- **And** service loading, routing, and configuration are validated
- **And** external completion functionality is verified

#### Scenario: Service Module Testing
- **Given** a generated service module
- **When** tests are executed for that module
- **Then** all operations are tested in mock mode
- **And** external completions are validated
- **And** error handling scenarios are covered

### Requirement: Mock Environment Integration
The existing mock system SHALL be enhanced to work seamlessly with the plugin architecture.

#### Scenario: Plugin-Wide Mock Mode
- **Given** mock mode is enabled globally
- **When** any service operation is executed through `nuaws`
- **Then** all operations use mock responses
- **And** no real AWS API calls are made
- **And** mock data is contextually appropriate

#### Scenario: Service-Specific Mock Mode
- **Given** mock mode is enabled for specific services
- **When** operations are executed for those services
- **Then** only those services use mock responses
- **And** other services make real AWS calls (if credentials available)
- **And** mixed mock/real scenarios work correctly

## REMOVED Requirements

None. This specification extends the existing system without removing functionality.
