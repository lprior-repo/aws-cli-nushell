# Universal Generator Enhancement Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Plugin-Compatible Module Generation
The universal generator SHALL produce modules that are fully compatible with the plugin architecture.

#### Scenario: Plugin Module Structure
- **Given** an AWS service schema is processed
- **When** the generator creates a service module
- **Then** the module exports all operations as functions
- **And** follows consistent naming conventions (kebab-case operations)
- **And** includes proper module metadata and documentation
- **And** integrates with plugin loading mechanisms

#### Scenario: External Completion Integration
- **Given** AWS operations have resource parameters
- **When** function signatures are generated
- **Then** appropriate external completion decorators are applied
- **And** completion functions are generated for resource types
- **And** completion dependencies are properly declared

#### Scenario: Plugin Registry Integration
- **Given** a service module is generated
- **When** the generation process completes
- **Then** the module is registered with the plugin system
- **And** operation metadata is added to service registry
- **And** help documentation is generated and indexed

### Requirement: Enhanced Function Signature Generation
The generator SHALL create type-safe function signatures optimized for Nushell pipeline usage.

#### Scenario: Pipeline-Optimized Return Types
- **Given** an AWS operation returns a list of records
- **When** the function signature is generated
- **Then** return type is specified as `table<>` with column types
- **And** single records are returned as `record` type
- **And** void operations return `nothing` type

#### Scenario: External Completion Parameter Decoration
- **Given** a parameter references an AWS resource
- **When** the function signature is generated
- **Then** parameter is decorated with appropriate completion function
- **And** completion function name follows naming conventions
- **And** context parameters are properly configured

#### Scenario: Optional Parameter Handling
- **Given** AWS operations have optional parameters
- **When** function signatures are generated
- **Then** optional parameters use proper Nushell default syntax
- **And** default values match AWS API defaults
- **And** parameter groups are logically organized

### Requirement: Performance-Optimized Code Generation
The generator SHALL produce code optimized for performance and resource usage.

#### Scenario: Lazy Loading Support
- **Given** AWS operations may return large datasets
- **When** function implementations are generated
- **Then** pagination is handled automatically
- **And** streaming tables are used for large results
- **And** memory usage is optimized for large datasets

#### Scenario: Caching Integration
- **Given** AWS operations benefit from caching
- **When** function implementations are generated
- **Then** appropriate caching patterns are applied
- **And** cache keys are generated based on operation parameters
- **And** cache TTL is appropriate for operation type

#### Scenario: Batch Operation Support
- **Given** AWS operations support batch processing
- **When** functions are generated
- **Then** batch variants are created where applicable
- **And** parallel execution is used for independent operations
- **And** error handling preserves individual operation results

### Requirement: Documentation and Help Generation
The generator SHALL create comprehensive documentation and help systems for generated modules.

#### Scenario: Inline Function Documentation
- **Given** AWS operations have documentation
- **When** functions are generated
- **Then** comprehensive doc strings are included
- **And** parameter descriptions are preserved from AWS docs
- **And** usage examples are generated

#### Scenario: Help System Integration
- **Given** a service module is generated
- **When** users request help for operations
- **Then** contextual help is displayed with examples
- **And** parameter validation errors include helpful suggestions
- **And** related operations are suggested

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Schema Processing Enhancement
The existing schema processing SHALL be enhanced to support plugin-specific patterns.

#### Scenario: Resource Relationship Discovery
- **Given** AWS schemas contain resource references
- **When** schemas are processed
- **Then** resource relationships are identified and mapped
- **And** completion dependencies are established
- **And** cross-service relationships are documented

#### Scenario: Type Mapping Enhancement
- **Given** AWS types need Nushell mapping
- **When** type conversion is performed
- **Then** native Nushell types are preferred (datetime, filesize, duration)
- **And** complex types are mapped to appropriate structures
- **And** type constraints are preserved and validated

### Requirement: Testing Code Generation
The existing test generation SHALL be enhanced for plugin compatibility.

#### Scenario: Plugin Test Generation
- **Given** a service module is generated
- **When** test code is created
- **Then** plugin-specific test patterns are included
- **And** external completion testing is generated
- **And** mock mode integration tests are created

#### Scenario: Integration Test Generation
- **Given** services have cross-dependencies
- **When** test suites are generated
- **Then** integration tests are created for workflows
- **And** service interaction patterns are validated
- **And** end-to-end scenarios are tested

### Requirement: Mock Response Enhancement
The existing mock system SHALL be enhanced with more sophisticated response generation.

#### Scenario: Contextual Mock Responses
- **Given** AWS operations require mock responses
- **When** mock data is generated
- **Then** responses are contextually appropriate for operation type
- **And** resource relationships are maintained in mock data
- **And** realistic data patterns are followed

## REMOVED Requirements

None. This specification enhances the existing generator without removing functionality.
